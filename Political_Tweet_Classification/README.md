# Political Tweet Classification

For this project, I was an analyst who worked for a US software company working with the US government.
Our client would like us to save their employees time by building a machine learning algorithm that will classify tweets as political or non-political.
This will save the client money by avoiding human labeling and enable quicker identification of users and their related texts.
