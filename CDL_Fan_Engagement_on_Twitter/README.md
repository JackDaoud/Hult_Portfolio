# CDL Fan Engagement on Twitter

For this project, I was an analytics professional working at a digital marketing agency. The marketing firm represents the Call of Duty League, an e-sports league with unique teams and players, some with large followings. I was asked to explore the the trove of fan tweets for this e-sports league and present my findings.
