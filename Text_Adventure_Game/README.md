This fantasy text adventure game consists of three rounds. The first is a brief dialogue with an elven oracle, the second is fortune telling using tarot cards to determine eligibility for a quest, and the third is the quest of a magic battle against an evil warlock who is keeping the queen of elves prisoner in a tower.
