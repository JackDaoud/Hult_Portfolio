# Windows or Mac?

Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance.

Recently, Apple has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. As such, our team has been commissioned to run an analysis on these factors.

Please refer to the [notebook](https://github.com/JackDaoud/MSc_Business_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/Windows_or_Mac/Analysis.ipynb) for the analysis.
