This fantasy text adventure game consists of three rounds. The first is a brief dialogue with an elven oracle, the second is fortune telling using tarot cards to determine eligibility for a quest, and the third is the quest of a magic battle against an evil warlock who is keeping the queen of elves prisoner in a tower. You'll cast magic by rolling dice. 

<b>Rounds</b>:

- <font color='blue'>Round 02</font>: Tarot Card Reading

<b>Known Bugs and/or Errors:</b>

Sometimes the script reruns a scene (function) randomly... 
I've seen it happen twice to the function question_02() before round_02() is run.
I've also seen it happen to round_03() after the game was won via pass_or_fail().
This rerun bug happens only sometimes when I play the game, but it doesn't happen
to others who've played the game.
