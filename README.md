# SQL_Advertising_Management_Platform
Final Team Project conducted with [Jack Daoud](https://github.com/JackDaoud) as a part of the Data Management & SQL class. 

## Files & Task
The task of this project was the creation of a Advertising management Platform for an external client. We, the consultants, were tasked with developing a high-level use-case, identifying current shortcomings in database solutions and solving key pain-points of the organization. 

### 1) Database 
I was tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a continuous response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

### 2) Queries 
I was tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a binary response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

**DISCLAIMER: All the data in the database is randomly generated**

Do not use any statistic contained in the report, all illustrative graphs and output tables have been created using randomly generated data to demonstrate how the database and queries would work.
