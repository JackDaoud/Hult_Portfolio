# SQL_Advertising_Management_Platform
Final Team Project conducted with [Jack Daoud](https://github.com/JackDaoud) as a part of the Data Management & SQL class. 

## Files & Task
The task of this project was the creation of a Advertising management Platform for an external client. We, the consultants, were tasked with developing a high-level use-case, identifying current shortcomings in database solutions and solving key pain-points of the organization. 

### 1) Regression Model Development
I was tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a continuous response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

### 2) Classification Model Development 
I was tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a binary response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

### 3) Unsupervised Analysis Project (with Team) 
Our team was tasked to analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data. This required an ability to code unsupervised machine learning algorithms and interpret their results.
