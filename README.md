# SQL_Advertising_Management_Platform
Final Team Project conducted with [Jack Daoud](https://github.com/JackDaoud) as a part of the Data Management & SQL class. 

## Files & Task
The task of this project was the creation of a advertising management platform for an external client. We, the consultants, were tasked with developing a high-level use-case, identifying current shortcomings in database solutions and solving key pain-points of the organization. 

### 1) Database 
Database with dummy data. This file contains the database (advertising management platform) we created. This database was filled with dummy data that does not reflect any real information (see disclaimer below).
