# NBA Fan Engagement on Twitter


For this project, I was "hired" at Nike in sports marketing specific to the National Basketball Association (NBA). My new bosses are interested in learning more about the commentary for popular teams, athletes, or the league as a whole from the perspective of fan engagement. I've been asked to apply new methods to explore a trove of fan tweets.
